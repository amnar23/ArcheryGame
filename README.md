# ArcheryGame
A unity-based, 3d game.  The primary goal of this project was/is to test the creation of custom assets with blender, and then apply them into a single scene.

All of the Scripts, BlenderObjects, and most of the Prefabs were created by Nicholas Marshman.  The skybox was from the asset-store (it was a free asset), and the music was provided by AShamaleuvMusic, a website with free and open-source music available for download ( There are some good tracks here, though they are poorly named imho, check them out: https://www.ashamaluevmusic.com/).
