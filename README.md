# ArcheryGame
A free, unity-based, 3d game.  The primary goal of this project was/is to test the creation of custom assets with blender, and then apply them into a single scene.  As such, this is more of a test-game than it is an actual game.

All of the Scripts, BlenderObjects, and most of the Prefabs were created by myself, Nicholas Marshman.  There was a tutorial being followed on youtube for the bow + arrow creation and for the scripts (though those are simple enough), since I never made a 3d game on unity before (past games have all been 2D ones, like the MonsterGame I have on my github as well), and I also have never utilized blender before either. I highly recommend you check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMx7tWwkV8. The skybox was from the asset-store (it was a free asset), and the music was provided by AShamaleuvMusic, a website with free and open-source music available for download ( There are some good tracks here, though they are poorly named imho :P.  Check them out here: https://www.ashamaluevmusic.com/).
