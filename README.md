# ArcheryGame
A free unity-based, 3d game.  The primary goal of this project was/is to test the creation of custom assets with blender, and then apply them into a single scene.  As such, this is more of a test-game than it is an actual game.

All of the Scripts, BlenderObjects, and most of the Prefabs were created by Nicholas Marshman.  The skybox was from the asset-store (it was a free asset), and the music was provided by AShamaleuvMusic, a website with free and open-source music available for download ( There are some good tracks here, though they are poorly named imho :P.  Check them out here: https://www.ashamaluevmusic.com/).
